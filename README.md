Idea-
1- everyone must have login id one they login for voting...
2- verify presence of voter through webcam at live voting with face recognisation wheather he/she is origional voter once he gets recognised than let him give his vote for that voter must give his identity stored before election day in database but with billions of face it will be difficult to find him but we know who is loginner than we just have to verify voters identity with face data of that perticular loginer's face id.  
3- one person allowed only 1 time to vote at a time 
4- once voting over the will get result immediately once they  login again
5- but no should be able to find for whom he voted for !
