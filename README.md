Idea-
  1st everyone must have login id one they login for voting...
  2nd veryfy presence of voter through webcam at live voting with face recognisation wheather he/she is origional voter once he gets recognised than let him give his vote for that voter must give his identity stored before election day in database but with billions of face it will be difficult to find him but we know who is loginner than we just have to verify voters identity with face data of that perticular login idennner.  
  3rd one person allowed only 1 time to vote at a time 
  4th once voting over the will get result immediately once they  login again
